# Counter Contract

## Overview
The Counter Contract is a Clarity smart contract designed to provide a simple counter functionality on the Stacks blockchain. This contract allows designated users to increment or decrement a counter value while implementing permission controls, maximum and minimum value limits, and event logging for key actions.

## Features
- **Permission Controls**: Only a designated "admin" address can modify the counter value.
- **Read-Only Function**: A public function to retrieve the current value of the counter.
- **Value Limits**: Maximum and minimum thresholds to prevent the counter from exceeding specified limits.
- **Admin Role Management**: A function to change or transfer the admin role to another address.
- **Event Logging**: Logs key actions such as incrementing, decrementing, and changing the admin.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd counter-contract
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile the Smart Contract**: 
   Ensure you have the necessary tools to compile Clarity contracts.

4. **Deploy the Contract**: 
   Use the provided deployment scripts to deploy the contract to the desired network (testnet or mainnet).

## Usage
- After deployment, interact with the contract using the provided functions to increment, decrement, or read the counter value.
- Ensure that only the admin address is used for modifying the counter.

## Testing
Comprehensive unit tests are provided to ensure the functionality and security of the contract. Run the tests using:
```
npm test
```
